prompt to change web image capture to index.html and index.css
```
I want to generate a webpage that accurately replicates the layout and style of website's homepage, as seen in the provided image. The task requires the following steps:
Input Requirements:
    Use the provided input image
    Analyze the layout and extract the following details:
        The position (x, y), dimensions (width, height), font sizes, colors, and alignment for all visible elements.
        Identify and tag sections of the page (e.g., Header, Hero Section, Content Cards, Footer) with proper <div> ids.
        Extract the structure, hierarchy, and relationships between elements (e.g., navigation links, content blocks, buttons, etc.).
Output Requirements:
    HTML File:
        Generate an index.html file with a clean structure using <div> tags and semantic elements for each section (e.g., <header>, <main>, <footer>).
        Ensure that the HTML references the CSS file for all styling and layout.
    CSS File:
        Generate a styles.css file with clear and organized styles for the entire page.
        Include styles for colors, dimensions, fonts, spacing, alignment, and responsive behavior.
        Use appropriate id or class names to map to the HTML structure.
    Accuracy and Features:
        Match the layout as closely as possible, including the spacing, fonts, and overall appearance.
        Create a responsive design to ensure the webpage works on various screen sizes.
        Remove unnecessary comments or placeholder text in the output (e.g., "Here is the HTML code").
        Ensure the navigation bar, hero section, content cards, and footer are correctly aligned and styled.
        Maintain clear separation of content, styling, and structure.
Deliverables:
    Save all generated files (index.html, styles.css) in an "output" folder.
    Avoid embedding CSS or JavaScript directly into the HTML (externalize all CSS into styles.css).
    Use clean and modern practices to ensure the webpage is optimized and maintainable.
Provide only the code for the above deliverables (no explanations or additional comments) so that I can directly copy and paste to test the webpage.
