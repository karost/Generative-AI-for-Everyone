4. Git

The gh command is part of the GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface), which is a separate tool from the standard Git installation that comes with macOS. While Git is pre-installed, the GitHub CLI needs to be installed separately to gain access to the gh command.
To install the GitHub CLI and enable the gh command on macOS, the recommended method is to use Homebrew:
- go to release page: [Release page](https://github.com/cli/cli/?tab=readme-ov-file)
- Use Mac Port:
  ```
   sudo port install gh
 
  ```
