# Generative AI for Everyone

**Why Generative AI for Everyone?** "Generative AI for Everyone" embodies the vision of making AI accessible to all, empowering beginners—everyday people with no tech background—to solve problems and address real-world issues using powerful AI tools. This course invites learners to master AI through free, hands-on training in a welcoming, practical way.

## Course Overview
The **Generative AI for Everyone** is a free, 10-module course designed for beginners with no prior AI or coding experience. It consolidates resources from Microsoft, OpenAI, and AWS to teach Generative AI fundamentals, low-code app development, and AI-driven code reverse engineering. Using tools like Jupyter Notebook, VS Code (with Cline AI agent extension), Aider, MCP server, AutoGen, Gemini CLI, and Qwen Code CLI, learners build skills through labs and a community forum. Content is sourced via sub-prompt searches across GitHub, AWS Skill Builder, OpenAI Academy, and X. The course emphasizes modern full-stack architectures (e.g., Next.js, Vue with Vite, PostgreSQL optimized by LLMs) to create practical, real-world applications. Low-code solutions require learning through prompt engineering and AI assistance, which, while imperfect, offer speed and accessibility. Module 9 addresses AI limitations to ensure success in Module 10’s final project.

## Why Take This Course?
